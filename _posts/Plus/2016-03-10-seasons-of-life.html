<blockquote>
We say that flowers return every spring, but that is a lie. It is true that the world is renewed. It is also true that that renewal comes at a price, for even if the flower grows from an ancient vine, the flowers of spring are themselves new to the world, untried and untested.
<br>
The flower that wilted last year is gone. Petals once fallen are fallen forever. Flowers do not return in the spring, rather they are replaced. It is in this difference between returned and replaced that the price of renewal is paid. -Danie Abraham. "The Price of Spring."

In our most recent AT-AT show, Tim and I talked about seasons of life. I explained to him that I once heard the great John Maxwell say at a certification conference that he "teaches seasons, not balance." Up to that point, I was always trying to find ways to balance my life. I wanted to make sure that I had time for everything and everyone that I wished to give attention to. I didn't realize that not only is this virtually impossible, but potentially unhealthy in some ways too. While life is certainly a balancing act, we rarely find ourselves able to sustain perfect balance for any amount of time. Something always shifts, something always changes. Life will always happen.
<br><br>
What I've discovered, so many times in my life, is that the person that I was is not capable of living the life that I desired. This applies to any season of life that I'm in. Whenever life starts heading in a new direction I find that it also requires a change in who I am to a certain extent. I might have to change my daily habits, change my circle of friends, change the people and the media that influence me, change my way of thinking, change my priorities, change my decisions, so on and so forth. While the core of who I am and my values remain largely the same, the rest of my life sometimes undergoes a massive overhaul. I used to fight this. I think as I've gotten older and experienced season after season, I'm starting to get a better handle on it. Although I will say, it is still difficult at times when I start to think and reflect on seasons gone by.
<br><br>
However, one thing that I have certainly learned and wish to convey to you as you go through your life seasons is that it is vital to your growth that you gather the lessons and the wisdom from each season and take them with you. History only repeats itself if you refuse to learn from it. Experience the seasons. Live in them while they're with you and really appreciate and enjoy them. Take the best of what you can from them and bring them forward in your life and be excited for what each new season will present to you. My life is in a LOT of flux and change right now and while it can be stressful, it's extremely exciting to prepare for what will come next. Always forward, as I used to say.
<br><br>
So, I too live life in seasons and I do my level best to live in each one and appreciate each one for what it is. Rather than trying to achieve balance in my life I strive to achieve harmony among the most important aspects of my life in any given season. Right now I'm feeling that God and family are major parts of the upcoming season, and being a NRD of course.
<br><br>
There's so much more to say. I could talk about all of the different seasons my life has gone through but I'm really interested to hear about yours. What have you experienced? How have you changed? What have you learned?
<br><br>
I'll leave you with this little bit from Tracy Hurst. I hope that it serves you well.

<blockquote>
“Friendships change yet...we often struggle with letting go of friendships that are no longer fruitful. Not letting go is rooted in fear and fear always leads to torment. Letting go allows us to trust God with our friendships, and when we are willing to let go and let God, He will either bring the friendship around in due time or bring in new friendships that will propel us forward into our destiny.
<br>
Here is what God has shown me:
A right association in a right season = right results
A wrong association in any season = wrong results
And a right association in a wrong season = wrong results"
